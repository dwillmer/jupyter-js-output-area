    This class provides an example server to allow local requests for the 
    data.json file in this output area demo.

    Making local file requests is not/should not be possible using the 
    XmlHttpRequest handler (for security reasons); in general javascript
    that fetches data from a different domain is frowned upon and is 
    legitimately a security concern, hence XSS (cross-site scripting) is not
    allowed.

    The solution to this is to allow CORS (cross-origin resource sharing), which allows
    the remote data to be fetched, but with much fewer security concerns than XSS.

    CORS is enabled server-side (there's nothing the client can do to request it,
    obviously) by adding the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' (ACAO) header to the 
    http response.
